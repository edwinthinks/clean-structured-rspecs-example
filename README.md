# What is this?

A minimal setup Ruby example on how to structure specs for (I believe) higher clarity and less lines of code.

## Installation

1. You first need to install [bundler](https://bundler.io/) if you haven't already. 

2. Clone this repo & navigate to root directory

3. Run `bundle`

## Run Specs

You can run this command to run the specs:

```
bundle exec rspec .
```
