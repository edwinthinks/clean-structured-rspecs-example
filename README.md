# clean-structured-rspecs-example [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/edwinthinks/clean-structured-rspecs-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/edwinthinks/clean-structured-rspecs-example)

A minimal setup Ruby example on how to structure specs using [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) for (I believe) higher clarity and less lines of code.

Explation can be found here.

## Installation

1. You first need to install [bundler](https://bundler.io/) if you haven't already. 

2. Clone this repo & navigate to root directory

3. Run `bundle` to install the gem dependencies for RSpec.

## Run Specs

You can run this command to run the specs:

```
bundle exec rspec .
```
